Other possible classifications were much less likely, including items like a \"stove\" or \"coil,\" but their scores were significantly lower.\n\nIf you're specifically looking to do defect detection on oil filters, this initial classification could help focus your inspection process on this object type, given its higher likelihood according to the tool.
